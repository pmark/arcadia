# Mission Log: Arcadia

## 2026-09-05 — Flight Deck board plan activated on operator direction

- **Scope:** Pointer change only; no Action implemented.
- **Did:** The operator chose the Flight Deck / Mission Control plan as the
  next `active_plan` directly (not inferred). `PROJECT.md` now points at
  `flight-deck-board-carries-the-whole-portfolio-on-one-surface` with
  `current_action: project-plan-lanes-and-pipeline-columns` — the plan's only
  Action with no unmet dependency. The plan document's `status` moves
  `draft` -> `active`, and `milestone` in `PROJECT.md` updates to match.
  Flipping it to active surfaced a real, separate defect: the plan was
  missing the `recommended_model` field the plan schema requires, which
  fails silently while a plan is `draft` (never dispatched, so never
  validated) but breaks parsing entirely once active — added
  `recommended_model: claude-sonnet-5`, matching every other plan.
- **Result:** `resolveDispatch` now resolves `project-plan-lanes-and-
  pipeline-columns` cleanly with zero blockers;
  `tests/managed-documents-contract.test.ts` passes. `agent-ask-execution-
  queue` keeps its own `current_action: dogfood-agent-managed-queue`
  untouched and un-competing, since `PROJECT.md` declaring its own
  `current_action` is what silences the "competing pointer" check for every
  other plan.
- **Next:** `flight-deck-board#project-plan-lanes-and-pipeline-columns` —
  render every governed object as one swimlane board (Plan lanes, dispatch-
  gate columns). Not started in this session; the operator asked only for
  activation.
- **Blockers:** None.

## 2026-09-05 — Way propagation delivers, and `way-delivery` reaches its milestone

- **Action:** `way-delivery#open-way-sync-pull-requests`
- **Did:** Built `arcadia way propagate`, delivering the two tiers Decision
  0024 defines: `src/projects/wayPropagation.ts` diffs an adopting
  repository's AGENTS.md region and CLAUDE.md wrapper (mechanical) and its
  CONSTITUTION.md and continuation protocol (governing) against Arcadia's
  canonical text, reusing the same pure generators `setup-context` writes
  with. `src/projects/wayPropagate.ts` orchestrates one pull request per
  repository through an injectable command runner — refusing a dirty working
  tree, a repository with no GitHub remote, or one whose
  `.arcadia/arcadia-way/adoption.json` declares `upgrade_policy:
  "explicit-only"` — and merges immediately only when a run touched the
  mechanical tier alone; a governing-tier change, alone or alongside a
  mechanical one, always leaves the pull request open. Wired as `arcadia way
  propagate [project-id] [--dry-run]`.
- **Result:** All five acceptance criteria covered by 12 new tests in
  `tests/way-propagation.test.ts`, including full orchestration against a
  real local Git repository and a local bare "origin" with `gh` faked
  through the injected runner. `tsc --noEmit` clean; full suite 1,212 passed,
  8 skipped, the same pre-existing worktree environment gaps untouched by
  this change. This was the last `open` Action in `way-delivery`, so the
  plan is marked `complete` and its milestone — every adopting project can
  receive Way changes and ask for Way capabilities without anyone writing
  Arcadia twice — is reached. `way-delivery` no longer designates a
  `current_action` (its `checked-in Arcadia control documents` contract test
  requires every active plan to resolve one, so leaving the pointer on a
  complete plan with none is a real defect, not a stylistic gap — CI caught
  it). `PROJECT.md`'s `active_plan` moves to `agent-ask-execution-queue`,
  which was already `status: active` with its own `current_action:
  dogfood-agent-managed-queue` declared — a competing pointer `resolveDispatch`
  already refused to allow alongside an active `way-delivery`. That Action is
  `blocked` behind open Decision 0041 and resolves as the operator question
  it already was, which is the sanctioned outcome here: the choice of the
  *next milestone* (`flight-deck-board-carries-the-whole-portfolio-on-one-
  surface`, still `draft`, is the evident candidate behind Arcadia's own
  recorded milestone) is a materially different decision than this session
  was dispatched to make, so it falls to the operator rather than being
  picked unilaterally to satisfy CI.
- **Next:** Operator answers Decision 0041 (reactivates
  `agent-ask-execution-queue`'s dogfood tail), or explicitly activates
  `flight-deck-board-carries-the-whole-portfolio-on-one-surface` instead.
- **Blockers:** None. Real propagation was implemented and tested against
  local fixtures only; it was not run against any real adopting repository
  in this session (that would push branches and, for a mechanical-only
  change, merge them without further review), pending the operator wanting
  a live run.

## 2026-09-05 — Decisions can carry options with consequences

- **Action:** `way-delivery#carry-decision-options`
- **Did:** Added an ordered `options` list to the Decision document type
  (`src/docs/types.ts`, `src/docs/parse.ts`), each entry a `label`, a
  `consequence`, and at most one `recommended: true`. `arcadia decision new`
  and Agent Ask's `decision` intent (`src/ask/agentAsk.ts`,
  `src/ask/settlement.ts`) both accept the same shape and render it as an
  "## Options" section ahead of "## Context", so an operator can pick a
  choice without reading the rationale first. `arcadia decision approve`
  now requires the `answer` to name one of the declared labels when options
  exist (case-insensitive match, recorded verbatim), and is unchanged for a
  Decision with none. `agent-ask contract` reports the new `options`
  envelope field and its per-option shape.
- **Result:** All five acceptance criteria covered by new tests in
  `tests/decision-command.test.ts`, `tests/agent-ask.test.ts`,
  `tests/agent-ask-settlement.test.ts`, and `tests/agent-ask-contract.test.ts`.
  Full suite: 1195 passed (up from 1186), the same 4 pre-existing failures
  unrelated to this change (missing `discord.js`/dashboard build artifacts
  in this environment). Marked the Action `done` and repointed
  `current_action` (in both `PROJECT.md` and the plan) to
  `stop-dumping-rationale-into-recommendation`, the next `agent`-
  responsibility Action with no unmet dependencies — `open-way-sync-pull-
  requests` sits earlier in the plan but is `requires_review`, not
  agent-dispatchable.
- **Next:** `way-delivery#stop-dumping-rationale-into-recommendation`, now
  the current Action.
- **Blockers:** None.

## 2026-09-05 — Closed out the codex→agent responsibility rename and repaired the stale pointer

- **Action:** `way-delivery#rename-codex-responsibility-to-agent`
- **Did:** Dispatch handed this Action to a fresh agent worktree, but every
  acceptance criterion was already satisfied by earlier work: `feat(domain):
  rename codex responsibility value to agent` (PR #164) and the follow-up
  fix cycle for the regression it caused (PR #165) had already landed
  `WORK_CLASSIFICATIONS`/`WORK_CLASSIFICATION_LABELS` using `agent`, the
  `responsibility: codex` → `agent` legacy-read normalization in
  `src/docs/parse.ts`, every plan document already rewritten to
  `responsibility: agent`, and test coverage for both the new literal value
  and the legacy spelling (`tests/docs-sync.test.ts`). What was missing was
  the record: both settle commits for that earlier work (`rename-codex-
  responsibility-log-2026-09-04`, `log-codex-responsibility-migration-fix-
  2026-09-05`) were Log-only Agent Asks, so this Action's `status` in
  `docs/plans/way-delivery.md` was never flipped to `done`, and `PROJECT.md`
  and the plan's `current_action` both still pointed at it — a stale pointer
  that would have kept re-dispatching finished work.
- **Result:** Verified every acceptance criterion directly (constants, parse.ts
  compatibility path, a repo-wide grep for `responsibility: codex` in
  `docs/plans/`, and the targeted test files), then marked the Action `done`
  and repointed `current_action` (in both `PROJECT.md` and the plan) to
  `carry-decision-options`, the next `agent`-responsibility Action with no
  unmet dependencies. `arcadia advance --json` now resolves cleanly with no
  blockers.
- **Next:** `way-delivery#carry-decision-options`, now the current Action.
- **Blockers:** None. Worth naming so it does not recur: an Agent Ask's
  `log` intent can settle without ever touching the Action it was about,
  so a session finishing real work under one request id should also confirm
  the plan document's own `status` and `current_action` fields moved, not
  just that a Log entry was written.

## 2026-09-02 — Gave Arcadia's own deferrals something that reads them

- **Action:** `way-delivery#evaluate-document-triggers`
- **Did:** Added `arcadia triggers`, a read-only noun reporting every deferral a
  repository declares and what each is doing now: `fired`, `waiting`,
  `unevaluable`, or `untriggered`. Machine-checkable conditions come from
  `.arcadia/triggers.json`, promoting the registry shape Private Practice Now
  proved, with `count` conditions read from repository-local JSON and `observed`
  conditions a person records. Prose deferrals are reported rather than
  evaluated, in every spelling the documents actually use — `**Trigger:**`,
  `*Trigger:`, `revives when`, and the `Reactivate when` tables that turned out
  to be the dominant form.
- **Result:** Arcadia's own repository reports **39 deferrals across 14
  documents** where nothing could previously list one, plus one deferred
  Decision that names no reviving condition at all. Run against Private
  Practice Now it evaluates its registry and reports **2 fired and 8 waiting**,
  with counts checked against real data — five sites, all `review`, zero
  `live`, so `0 of 5 match; 3 needed` is correct. Eleven focused tests cover
  both condition kinds, malformed and future-schema registries, an unsupported
  kind, a count file escaping the repository, all four prose spellings,
  frontmatter restatement, prose *about* triggers, and proof the command writes
  nothing. Full suite passes 1,197 with 6 skipped.
- **Next:** `way-delivery#accept-upstream-proposals`, now the current Action.
- **Blockers:** None. Two findings worth recording: Decision 0028 claimed
  Decisions 0021 through 0027 carried `**Trigger:**` clauses, and they no longer
  do — their deferrals are `Reactivate when` tables instead, which is why a
  reader built to 0028's description alone would have found nothing. And the
  first parser written here silently dropped a mid-line clause, the exact
  failure this Action exists to end; it was caught only by counting the results
  against a manual grep.

## 2026-09-02 — Made the Agent Ask contract reach every adopting project

- **Action:** `way-delivery#propagate-agent-ask-contract`
- **Did:** Added an "Asking Arcadia to change Project state" section to
  `docs/agents-context.md`, the region propagated into every adopting
  AGENTS.md: the command an agent runs from its own repository without knowing
  Arcadia's workspace path, the rule that a proposal is never self-approving, a
  table of all ten intents with what each changes and whether it opens a
  Decision, and three worked examples covering the distinct envelope shapes.
  Added `arcadia agent-ask contract`, a read-only noun that prints the live
  schema from the parser's own constants so an agent can confirm rather than
  trust a possibly stale copy. Exported the constants it derives from.
- **Result:** `project setup-context --all` wrote the section into all five
  adopting repositories, verified by reading each AGENTS.md from disk rather
  than by trusting exit status; Private Practice Now carries all ten intents
  and all three examples where it previously had zero mentions of Agent Ask.
  `arcadia way` reports 5 current, 0 stale. The contract command runs from
  Private Practice Now's checkout with no workspace, Project, or database. A
  focused test asserts its intent list equals AGENT_ASK_INTENTS and its field
  lists equal STRICT_FIELDS and STRICT_ACTION_FIELDS, so prose and parser
  cannot drift. Full suite passes 1,179 with 6 skipped.
- **Next:** Implement `arcadia triggers`, the current Action under the pointer.
- **Blockers:** None for this Action. Two findings recorded but not fixed:
  `.arcadia/repo-context.md` rewrites a `Generated:` timestamp on every run, so
  `setup-context` always dirties the tree and then blocks `agent-ask settle
  --apply`, which refuses on a dirty repository; and the local `arcadia` shim
  prints banner lines before `--json` output, which would break an agent
  piping it.

## 2026-09-01 — Dogfooded Agent Ask and the queue, then activated way-delivery

- **Action:** `agent-ask-execution-queue#dogfood-agent-managed-queue`
- **Did:** Ran the Ask-to-queue path on real work rather than fixtures. A
  natural-language reprioritization request was submitted through
  `agent-ask preview`, correctly refused to guess, and opened Decision 0042;
  the operator's answer ratified it. A strict `plan` envelope targeting the
  active Plan then created two Actions with zero required Decisions and zero
  conflicts, and two applied `advance queue reorder` moves exercised
  preview/apply, optimistic revisions, and undo receipts. Decision 0043 then
  moved the pointer to `way-delivery` at `evaluate-document-triggers`, which
  `arcadia next` and `arcadia docket` both resolve with full authorization.
- **Result:** Queue order does not grant dispatch authority: two Arcadia
  Actions sat at positions 0 and 1 reported as `waiting_for_pointer` while
  Arcadia selected a pointer-authorized Action beneath them and explained the
  skip. Four newly activated Actions with no explicit positions set
  `orderValid` false and the next Action to `None` rather than inferring
  priority from document order; one explicit placement restored revision 11.
  Three real defects surfaced. Natural-language Ask punts to a generic
  interpretation Decision even when the repository names the plan, Action, and
  Decision — now a governed Action. Decision 0042 duplicated Decision 0041's
  question with nothing to catch it — now a governed Action, with 0042 against
  0041 as its named regression fixture. Agent Ask derives Action ids by
  slugifying the whole `desired_result`, producing 70-plus character ids, one
  truncated mid-word at `-alrea`; those ids are the handle for every reorder
  and `depends_on`, so it is filed separately. Focused tests pass 31/31.
- **Next:** Implement `arcadia triggers` under the new pointer.
- **Blockers:** Phone-width browser QA and independent PR QA for
  `dogfood-agent-managed-queue` have not run, so that Action stays open with
  its question unanswered. Writing this entry broke
  `managed-documents-contract` by naming two Actions and omitting `Result`,
  which is itself evidence that the contract is enforced only by the full
  suite and never at authoring time.

## 2026-09-01 — Made Plans writable and reprioritizable through Agent Ask

- **Action:** `agent-ask-execution-queue#enable-coding-agents-to-naturally-create-amend-and-reprioritize-plan-shaped-work`
- **Did:** Extended strict Agent Ask v1 so one `plan` envelope can carry shared
  and per-Action references, create a complete inactive draft Plan, or target a
  named Plan to create and amend Actions. Active-Plan settlement can now move
  every unfinished Plan Action at one approved top/before/after boundary while
  deriving a stable dependency-safe segment. It refuses incomplete Actions,
  dependency cycles, cross-Project targets, stale revisions, unpositioned
  queues, and any attempt to queue a draft. Updated the canonical operator
  guide and CLI help.
- **Result:** Focused tests pass 23/23, the corrected full suite passes 1,170
  with 6 skipped, core and Discord TypeScript builds pass, and the live services were
  restarted from the committed feature branch. Real Plan Ask
  `agent-plan-priority-dogfood-20260901` amended the current Action and moved
  the two unfinished Arcadia Plan Actions as one queue segment at the top.
  Settlement `asksettle_1c38b693b26b492999` recorded the exact Plan and queue
  effects, resulting next Action, and operator-accep
